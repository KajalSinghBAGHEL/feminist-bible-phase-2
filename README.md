What is Feminist Bible?
The Feminist Bible is "Made for all, by women."
It is an inclusive space for all. A place where we empathize, acknowledge, and promote diversity by creating an inclusive ecosystem powered by shared stores, culturally sensitive content, and equity-driven community philosophy.
Create a sense of belonging for all. Promote awareness by sharing the unheard voices of underrepresented and diverse people.
Spread kindness, positivity, hope, curiosity, and fun in people's lives.
Are you ready to share your story, participate in the positive and impactful movement, and be change-makers?
Are you ready to embark on a memorable, purposeful, inspirational, and fulfilling journey? Come on, join Maybelyn Plecic, Rashmeet Kaur, and the Feminist Bible team!
